# Django website project

## Intro

This is a personal project of mine to enhance my django Software Engineering skills.
The goal is to make a website with all kind of projects on it.
The main project for now is creating an personal version of the IMDb movie database website. Here I store information about movies I want to watch and have watched. I'm using Django class based views for this, which I'm new to, so there is a lot to learn.

## Setup

Create a venv from the pip requirements in `requirements.txt`.
Or create a conda environment from `spec-file.txt`.
In a later version I will transfer the whole project to a venv instead of a conda environment.
When that happens I will include instructions on how to install the venv.

Populating the database can be done with `python manage.py create_reviews`.

## kanban board

The project has a kanban board in the `.vscode/` folder.
It uses the [vscode-kanban extention](https://github.com/mkloubert/vscode-kanban)
